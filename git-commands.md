# Git on the command Line

We can use the git version control application directly from the command line.
Here are some useful commands to get started.

- `git init` - This command will create a git repo in the current folder.
- `git status` - This will give you the current status of your git repo.
- `git add` - Use this command to "stage" all of your current changes so they're
  ready to be commited.
- `git commit -m "Your message"` - This command will take all of the staged
  changes and create a snapshot of the current state of your repo. Using commits
  is how we generate a "commit history" for our repository. `git pull` - Used to
  grab any changes from your remote repo (eg. GitHub.com) and pull them down to
  your local repository (on your computer). `git push` - Used to take whatever
  commits you have on your computer and push them to the remote repo on
  GitHub.com

There are a lot of things to learn when it comes to working with git, but these
commands are the day-to-day ones that you will do as you work with vesion
control.

**_Tip:_** You should make small and frequent commits when working on your
projects.
